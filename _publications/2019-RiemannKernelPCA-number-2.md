Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disease in which people experience unwanted and repetitive thoughts or behaviors. However, clinical diagnosis of OCD is always assigned by scales and observations, which is easily affected by psychologists’ subjection and patients’ reluctance of admitting such neurological disease. In this study, we proposed a classification model to diagnosis OCD patients from healthy controls using functional MR images. Functional connectivity (FC) matrices were composed of functional correlation between each pair of brain ROI. To preserve the topological information in FC matrices, we proposed a novel Riemann Kernel PCA as feature extractor. Hierarchical features were then fed into an ensemble classifier based on XGBoost algorithm. Next, we used the decisive features during classification to investigate the brain FC variations among OCD patients and healthy controls. Results show that the classification accuracy reaches 91.8%. Using PCA reconstruction algorithm, we could retrieve the important features which are decisive to the classifier. Besides the well-known CSTC (cortico–striatal–thalamic–cortical) circuit, cerebellum was also reported as a highly related region. Post hoc analysis included using three functional cerebellum regions as seeds and computed their whole brain connectivity maps for group comparison, respectively. Results of seed based analysis show that OCD patients have decreased posterior cerebellar connections in thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex and temporal cortex. These findings could help the understanding of the pathology of OCD and may also contribute to its early detection.
