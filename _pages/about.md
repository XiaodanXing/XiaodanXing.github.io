About Me
------
I am currently a R&D engineer in Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence. I recieved my master's degree of Electrical Engineering in Shanghai Advanced Research Institute at July 2020 under the co-supervision of Dr. Xu CHU and Professor Dinggang SHEN. I got my bachlor's degree of Physics in Fudan University at July 2017. My major research insteret lies on medical imaging analysis, especially the explainablity of neural networks in medical imaging scenario. My previous research projects include modeling brain functions using graph structure. I will go to UCLA next fall (hopefully so) to pursue a Ph.D. degree, and my mentor will be [Dr. Fabien SCALZO](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~fab/).


Code and Data Availability

My previous projects were accomplished under the financial support from Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence and Shanghai United Imaging Co., Ltd., thus I am unable to publicize the source codes of these projects. Please contact my PI Dr. Feng Shi if you need the codes and data.
