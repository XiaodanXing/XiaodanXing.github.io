About Me
------
I am currently a Ph.D. student at Imperial College London, supervised by Dr. Guang Yang (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.yang). I used to work for Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence, which is a great place and I will always remember my times there. I recieved my master's degree of Electrical Engineering in Shanghai Advanced Research Institute at July 2020 under the co-supervision of Dr. Xu CHU and Professor Dinggang SHEN. I got my bachlor's degree of Physics in Fudan University at July 2017. My major research insteret lies on medical imaging analysis, especially the explainablity of neural networks in medical imaging scenario. My previous research projects include modeling brain functions using graph structure.
